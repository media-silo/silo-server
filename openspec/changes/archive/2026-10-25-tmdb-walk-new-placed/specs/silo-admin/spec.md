## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: A missing child chosen in a walk is a new container, created when the walk is stored
A missing child chosen at a stop of a walk SHALL join the walk, when the stop is confirmed, as a new
stop beneath it: a draft from TMDb, read as a draft from TMDb reads it, with ids from smddb's client.
It SHALL be drafted once, however many times the stop is confirmed, and the console SHALL take no
second confirm of a stop while one is under way. The walk's tree SHALL show it as new. Its fields and
references, and any artwork TMDb offers for it, SHALL be chosen to begin with. It SHALL be shaped as a
draft from TMDb is shaped, and each container the shaping makes beneath it SHALL be a new stop; one
the shaping ungroups, or unticks, SHALL leave the walk, and the specials placed in it SHALL be
unassigned again; one ticked again SHALL be a new stop once the stop above it is confirmed again.
Specials SHALL be placeable in a new stop as in a held one, and a new stop SHALL show the specials
placed in it as a held stop does, each with how it was placed and a way to unassign it. A new stop
SHALL be made only once it is confirmed: storing the walk SHALL create it through the create route,
with the containers beneath it in one creation, right after the edit of its parent that names it, since
the create route makes a container beneath a parent only once the parent names it. Unchoosing a missing
child and confirming its parent's stop again SHALL remove its new stop and every stop beneath it from
the walk, after the console says which, and the specials placed in them SHALL be unassigned again.

#### Scenario: a season TMDb has that the library lacks
- **WHEN** a missing season is chosen at a held series' stop, and the stop is confirmed
- **THEN** the season is a new stop beneath the series, titled as TMDb titles it, with TMDb's year and
  references chosen

#### Scenario: a stop confirmed twice at once
- **WHEN** a missing season is chosen at a held series' stop, and the stop is confirmed twice before
  either confirm has finished
- **THEN** the season is one new stop beneath the series

#### Scenario: a special placed in a new season
- **WHEN** a special is placed as an entry of a new season, and the walk is stored
- **THEN** the season is created holding the entry, after the series' edit that names the season

#### Scenario: a special placed as an extra of a new serial
- **WHEN** a special is placed as an extra of a serial a new season's episodes were grouped into, while
  the serial's stop is open
- **THEN** the serial's stop shows the special among those placed there, as an extra of the serial, and
  unassigning it there returns it to the unassigned specials

#### Scenario: a new season regrouped
- **WHEN** a new season's episodes are regrouped into two serials
- **THEN** each serial is a new stop beneath the season

#### Scenario: a new season's serial ungrouped
- **WHEN** a serial a new season's episodes were grouped into, with a special placed in it, is
  ungrouped
- **THEN** the serial's stop leaves the walk, and the special is unassigned again

#### Scenario: a new season's serial unticked
- **WHEN** a serial a new season's episodes were grouped into, with a special placed in it, is
  unticked, and later ticked again and the season confirmed again
- **THEN** the serial's stop leaves the walk and the special is unassigned again, and once ticked again
  the serial is a stop beneath the season once more

#### Scenario: a new season unchosen
- **WHEN** a missing season chosen earlier is unchosen, and the series' stop is confirmed again
- **THEN** the season's stop and its serials' stops leave the walk, and a special placed in one of them
  is unassigned again
