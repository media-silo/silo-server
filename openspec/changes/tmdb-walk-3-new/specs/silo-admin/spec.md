## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: A missing child chosen in a walk is a new container, created when the walk is stored A
missing child chosen at a stop of a walk SHALL join the walk, when the stop is confirmed, as a new stop
beneath it: a draft from TMDb, read as a draft from TMDb reads it, with ids from smddb's client. The
walk's tree SHALL show it as new. Its fields, references and artwork SHALL be chosen to begin with. It
SHALL be shaped as a draft from TMDb is shaped, and each container the shaping makes beneath it SHALL
be a new stop. Specials SHALL be placeable in a new stop as in a held one. Storing the walk SHALL
create each new container through the create route before any creation or edit that refers to it, each
parent before its children. Unchoosing a missing child and confirming its parent's stop again SHALL
remove its new stop and every stop beneath it from the walk, after the console says which.

#### Scenario: a season TMDb has that the library lacks
- **WHEN** a missing season is chosen at a held series' stop, and the stop is confirmed
- **THEN** the season is a new stop beneath the series, with TMDb's title, year and references chosen

#### Scenario: a special placed in a new season
- **WHEN** a special is placed as an entry of a new season, and the walk is stored
- **THEN** the season is created holding the entry, before the series' edit that names the season

#### Scenario: a new season regrouped
- **WHEN** a new season's episodes are regrouped into two serials
- **THEN** each serial is a new stop beneath the season

#### Scenario: a new season unchosen
- **WHEN** a missing season chosen earlier is unchosen, and the series' stop is confirmed again
- **THEN** the season's stop and its serials' stops leave the walk

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: A held container's differences from TMDb are listed, and the operator takes each or leaves it
For a container the library holds, SiloAdmin SHALL read TMDb's record of the container's `tmdb`
reference, as a draft from TMDb reads it. A container with no `tmdb` reference of its own SHALL be read
through the nearest container above it that has one, or, when none above it has one, through a
container of the library that refers to its items; its differences SHALL be about the entries it
holds. Picking from TMDb a record whose reference a container of the library carries SHALL open that
container's differences. A TMDb id SHALL count as covered when the container, a container beneath it,
or an item the container refers to carries it, or when the container's sidecar declines it. The
console SHALL list how the library's sidecar differs from the reading:

- a title, year or outline that differs, the outline shown with its attribution;
- each provider's id TMDb holds that the sidecar lacks, for the container and for each entry it holds;
- each of TMDb's episodes or seasons, other than a special, whose id is not covered, with where TMDb
  puts it;
- items that both hold, at the same level, in a different order;
- each artwork kind the container's folder has no file for and TMDb has an image for;
- for a series, each special whose id is not covered, as unassigned, to be placed or declined as a
  draft's specials are, with its suggestion;
- for a series, collapsed, each special its sidecar declines, which the operator may place after all,
  removing the decline.

An item, child or extra the library holds and TMDb does not SHALL be shown, and SHALL NOT be offered
for removal. Each difference SHALL be chosen or not, none chosen to begin with, and one not chosen
SHALL change nothing. Each group's differences SHALL be chosen all at once or none, the group showing
when only some of them are chosen. Confirming the container's stop in a walk SHALL keep its chosen
field, reference, entry and order differences as one pending edit of the container, based on the
sidecar its stop read, carrying the outline's attribution when the outline is chosen, and the declined
refs when a special is declined or placed after all, and stored when the walk is stored. A special
placed in a duplicate's home or a breakout SHALL be an edit of that container too, and the console
SHALL list every edit before it stores any. A chosen child container SHALL join the walk as a new stop
beneath the container. Chosen artwork SHALL be put with its attribution when the walk is stored. The
console SHALL read a container against TMDb only when its stop is opened, or as the next stop to be
opened.

#### Scenario: an episode TMDb has gained
- **WHEN** a season the library holds lacks an episode TMDb's record of the season has, and the
  operator chooses that difference alone, confirms the season's stop and stores the walk
- **THEN** the season's edit adds one entry carrying the episode's references at TMDb's position, and
  changes nothing else

#### Scenario: an extra TMDb does not know
- **WHEN** a container the library holds has an extra that TMDb's record has nothing for
- **THEN** the extra is shown, and nothing offers to remove it

#### Scenario: a serial with no reference of its own
- **WHEN** a serial with no TMDb reference, beneath a season that has one, holds an episode whose
  IMDb id TMDb holds and the serial's sidecar lacks
- **THEN** the serial's differences list that IMDb id against the episode's entry

#### Scenario: episodes regrouped into serials
- **WHEN** a season holds every one of TMDb's episodes for it within serials beneath it
- **THEN** no episode is listed as missing, and no order difference is listed

#### Scenario: specials placed elsewhere or declined
- **WHEN** a series refers to one special's home in another library and to another special's entry in
  a breakout, and its sidecar declines a third
- **THEN** none of the three is listed as unassigned, and the third is listed among the declined

#### Scenario: a special TMDb has gained
- **WHEN** TMDb's season 0 for a series the library holds has gained a special nothing covers
- **THEN** the special is listed as unassigned, with a suggestion, and not as a missing episode

#### Scenario: a breakout read through the series that refers to it
- **WHEN** a breakout with no TMDb reference holds entries a series refers to, and TMDb holds an IMDb
  id for one of those specials that the breakout's entry lacks
- **THEN** the breakout's differences list that IMDb id against the entry

yet, as the rest of the shell is.
